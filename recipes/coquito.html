        <strong>Coquito</strong> is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico.
        In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. 
        Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."

        <strong>Coquito</strong> is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor.
        It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks.
        It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass
        cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Evaporated milk</b>: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>
        <li><b>Cream of coconut</b>: Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Sweetened condensed milk</b>: Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
        <li><b>White rum</b>: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
        <li><b>Water</b>: Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
        <li><b>Vanilla</b>: A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li><b>Spices</b>: Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
